The 90 seconds spans the point in the stream from when you called the API. For example, if you call the API at the 4:00 minute mark, the API captures from approximately the 2:35 mark to approximately the 4:05 minute mark. Twitch tries its best to capture 90 seconds of the stream, but the actual length may be less. This may occur if you begin capturing the clip near the beginning or end of the stream.\nBy default, Twitch publishes up to the last 30 seconds of the 90 seconds window and provides a default title for the clip. To specify the title and the portion of the 90 seconds window that’s used for the clip, use the URL in the response’s `edit_url` field. You can specify a clip that’s from 5 seconds to 60 seconds in length. The URL is valid for up to 24 hours or until the clip is published, whichever comes first.\nCreating a clip is an asynchronous process that can take a short amount of time to complete. To determine whether the clip was successfully created, call [Get Clips](#get-clips) using the clip ID that this request returned. If Get Clips returns the clip, the clip was successfully created.

Typically, you’ll send a GET request, update the fields you want to change, and pass that object in the PUT request.\nYou may set either `overall_level` or the individual settings like `aggression`, but not both.\nSetting `overall_level` applies default values to the individual settings. However, setting `overall_level` to 4 does not necessarily mean that it applies 4 to all the individual settings. Instead, it applies a set of recommended defaults to the rest of the settings. For example, if you set `overall_level` to 2, Twitch provides some filtering on discrimination and sexual content, but more filtering on hostility (see the first example response).\nIf `overall_level` is currently set and you update `swearing` to 3, `overall_level` will be set to *null* and all settings other than `swearing` will be set to 0. The same is true if individual settings are set and you update `overall_level` to 3 — all the individual settings are updated to reflect the default level.\nNote that if you set all the individual settings to values that match what `overall_level` would have set them to, Twitch changes AutoMod to use the default AutoMod level instead of using the individual settings.\nValid values for all levels are from 0 (no filtering) through 4 (most aggressive filtering).
