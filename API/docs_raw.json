Typically, you’ll send a GET request, update the fields you want to change, and pass that object in the PUT request.\nYou may set either `overall_level` or the individual settings like `aggression`, but not both.\nSetting `overall_level` applies default values to the individual settings. However, setting `overall_level` to 4 does not necessarily mean that it applies 4 to all the individual settings. Instead, it applies a set of recommended defaults to the rest of the settings. For example, if you set `overall_level` to 2, Twitch provides some filtering on discrimination and sexual content, but more filtering on hostility (see the first example response).\nIf `overall_level` is currently set and you update `swearing` to 3, `overall_level` will be set to *null* and all settings other than `swearing` will be set to 0. The same is true if individual settings are set and you update `overall_level` to 3 — all the individual settings are updated to reflect the default level.\nNote that if you set all the individual settings to values that match what `overall_level` would have set them to, Twitch changes AutoMod to use the default AutoMod level instead of using the individual settings.\nValid values for all levels are from 0 (no filtering) through 4 (most aggressive filtering). These levels affect how aggressively AutoMod holds back messages for moderators to review before they appear in chat or are denied (not shown)."
